L-systems were conceived as a mathematical framework for modeling growth of plants. 
L-Py is a simulation software that mixes L-systems construction with the Python high-level modeling language. 
In addition to this software module, an integrated visual development environment has been developed that facilitates the creation of plant models. 
In particular, easy to use optimization tools have been integrated. 
Thanks to Python and its modular approach, this framework makes it possible to integrate a variety of tools defined 
in different modeling context, in particular tools from the OpenAlea platform. 
Additionally, it can be integrated as a simple growth simulation module into more complex computational pipelines.

Plant high-throughput phenotyping aims at capturing the genetic variability of plant response to environmental factors for thousands of plants, 
hence identifying heritable traits for genomic selection and predicting the genetic values of allelic combinations in different environment.
This first implies the automation of the measurement of a large number of traits to characterize plant growth, plant development and plant functioning. 
It also requires a fluent and versatile interaction between data and continuously evolving plant response models, 
that are essential in the analysis of the marker x environment interaction and in the integration of processes for predicting crop performance.
